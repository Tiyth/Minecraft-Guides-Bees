You can breed your new Common bees with another Hive bee to get Cultivated bees. Again, following the same process, Breed your Common - Common bees with either a Meadows (Princess) or a Forest (Princess). Cultivated bees are a good bee to keep running for a while, as they are the base of many lines of bees. You want to end up with a Cultivated - Cultivated Princess.
