Before getting into any of Binnie's mods, it is highly advised that you go through the normal bee breeding process. Not only will this give you an idea of how bees work, but it will also provide you with a high number of Drones (which in turn means Princesses and Queens) to work with.

Diving into these mods will require some infrastructure, like power and various mob and animal farms, to maintain the amount of materials and power these machines need in order for the whole process to run.

In some cases, you will need an Alveary in order to start genetics.

The Genetics mod allows you to genetically modify Bees, Trees, flowers and butterflies, and allows you to inoculate them with all the traits you desire. This guide assumes that you are going into this knowing how to Breed bees, and you are aware of how cross-breeding works, along with traits.
