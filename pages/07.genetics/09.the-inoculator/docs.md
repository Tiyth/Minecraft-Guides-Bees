Once your Serums are full of DNA (they will land in the output slot on the right) you are ready to inoculate your first Larva.

![](The%20Inoculator.jpg)


Insert your full Serum Array into the Inoculator, along with a Larva. Fill the Inoculated with Bacteria Vector. This is another long process. It takes around an hour per gene, but once itâ€™s done, you will have a new Larva. The last step of this process is to now Incubate the Larva.
