So now that we’ve covered all these bees, you might be interested in useful applications for these. Here are some bees that are commonly used:

**Bees as power**
Required mods: Extra Bees, CareerBees, Gendustry.

Using Energy bees in Industrial Apiaries with 1 Automation and 8 production upgrades, you can generate 15kRF/bee/tick. A full guide can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/7vwadh/atm3_bee_power_15000_rft_from_one_bee/) (Credits to u/HerrKnarz).

As mentioned in the comments, output can be greatly improved (860%?) by using Alvearies. Needs confirmation.

|Never Sleeps | True| Ender Bee |
| Cave Dwelling | True | Rocky Bee |
| Rain Tolerant | True | Water Bee | 

**Bees as power II**
Required mods: Extra Bees, Environmental Tech, Gendustry
>>>>> This setup is more experimental than the one above. Starting it takes a lot of power, and you’re not guaranteed to have all lightning bolts hit the rods.

Using Energetic bees, you can summon Lightning strikes. We can use these with an Environmental Tech Lightning Rod to get a LOT of power.

In testing, this setup gave me 112 GRF (112,000,000,000 RF) in just under 6 hours.
Keep in mind that more Lightning rods increase the chance of it hitting. Again, make sure they are always 1 apart to not interfere. More Apiaries will increase the frequency of lightning strikes.

**Beegone, mobs!**
Required mods: Extra Bees, Career Bees
Using bees, we can make easy mob grinders. I’m not gonna post the entire trait lists, since they’re practically identical to the ones above except for Effect.

Place three industrial apiaries on top of each other. Top one will have a bee that spawns your mob (see table below). The center one will hold a Police Bee, and the bottom one a Collector Bee (I recommend Territory Largest on these two).

Power all three apiaries, and set up item transfer from the bottom two to a chest, and filter out Police Incident Reports. You now have a fully-functional mob grinder powered by bees.

| Bee | Mob |

| Decaying Bee | Zombies |
| Skeletal Bee | Skeletons |
| Creepy Bee | Creepers |
| Brainy Bee | Brainy Zombies |
| Wispy Bee | Wisps |
| Batty Bee | Firebats |
| Ghastly Bee | Ghasts |
| Spidery | Spiders |
| Smouldering | Blazes |
