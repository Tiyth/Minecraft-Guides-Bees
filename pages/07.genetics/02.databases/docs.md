There are databases for each section of this mod: Bees (Apiarist Database), Flowers (Botanist Database), Trees (Arborist Database) and Butterflies (Lepidopterist Database). When right-clicked, these will tell you all of the bee (butterfly, tree, etc.) species you have found.

You can put this into a Lab stand so you don't have to carry the database around with you all the time.

You need to craft a Gene Bank. This will become more important later on in the mod, as it displays how many Genes you have isolated for Trees, Bees, Flower and Butterflies. This also fits into a Lab Stand.
