You need a steady supply of the following materials (use JEI to find out the rest of what is not covered here).

Biomass - In the Fermentor, put Water, Fertilizer and Saplings to get Biomass. Extra Trees saplings will work better and give you better yield. You can also use Fruit Juice instead of water (you will get a better yield) but this requires you to have a steady supply and some sort of tree farm.

**Ethanol** - Run your Biomass through a Still.

**Liquid Growth Medium** - This can be made in the Incubator by filling the Incubator with water and adding in Growth Medium (Bone Meal and Sugar in a crafting grid).

**Bacteria** - Set up Another Incubator, pump Liquid Growth Medium in and use Wheat to process the Liquid Growth Medium into Bacteria .

**Enzymes** - Set up another Incubator, pump in the Bacteria and add Sugar. This will give you Enzyme (this is not a liquid).

**Polymerising Bacteria** - Set up another Incubator, pump in Bacteria and throw in Bone meal.

**Bacteria Vector** - Set up another Incubator, pump in Bacteria and throw in Blaze Powder.

Focus on mass producing all of these liquids products.
