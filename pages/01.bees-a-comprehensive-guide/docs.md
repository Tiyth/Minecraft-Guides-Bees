This guide covers a range of Minecraft mods related to Bees and aims to be the main source of everything to do with Bees. Whenever bees are added to any pack, there are always the same set of Bee-related mods used in conjunction with Forestry to make life easier and to add a whole bunch of other features. This guide covers each mod in detail and can still be used to guide you through your Bee adventures

This guide will get you breeding bees for all sorts of resources in no time, but it will cover the basics first. It’s advised that you know how to breed bees the “old School” way before jumping into full automation, some modpacks will also gate certain blocks for bee automation behind certain bees. You will have more of a clue about things if you understand the process and how machines can help. Feel free to skip to certain parts by searching.


### Other Resources
