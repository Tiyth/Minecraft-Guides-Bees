Once you have your Genetic Template (you do not have to fill in all 13 traits, just 1) you can add this into the Imprinter (this also requires power and Genetic labware), along with a bee, and it will write that template onto a bee.

![](Genetic%20Imprinter.jpg)

If you had a Template filled out with a Common Species sample and you inserted a Meadows bee it would be converted into a Common bee. The other 12 traits will be written randomly. Do not print genes into a Queen, there is a chance her child won't have the genes you changed. To make sure all future generations have the genes you want, change the gene of both a drone and a princess, and breed them together.
