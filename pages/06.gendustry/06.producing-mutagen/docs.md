Before we get into bees we will need to get Mutagen. To produce it, insert redstone into a Mutagen Producer. You need this Mutagen to FORCE mutations in a machine, rather than in an Apiary.

Throwing in blocks of redstone should give you a bucket of Mutagen. This can then be pumped into a Mutatron.
