Once the Genetic Replicator is full, add a Gene Template that has ALL 13 traits filled in. Once a complete Gene Template is put into the machine, a Queen will be created. This queen will have all the traits that you selected, BUT it will be Ignoble. 

Every Queen you create will be Ignoble. Every bee you create will die at some point. This is why you need to keep your Gene Templates.
