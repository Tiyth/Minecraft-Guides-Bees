The Portable Analyzer is one of the most important tools when trying to breed bees. It tells you everything you need to know about your Queen/Drone/Princess. It can tell you what flowers your queen needs and what type of byproducts you can expect. It will help you troubleshoot all your problems when it comes to bees.

The Analyzer is also used for butterflies and trees.

It’s best to craft one of these as soon as possible. It costs a diamond, but like I said, it will make the breeding process a lot quicker. Without it, you will just be guessing your way through bees since JEI does not give you all the details.

To use the Portable Analyzer you need to use Honey. You can get this from combs. The important thing to note is that each time you want to analyze a bee (or a tree or butterfly) you will consume one honey. So make sure you have enough on hand. If you are having trouble with honey, you can always use a bee house with a forest queen. This will give you a steady supply of honey.

When you open the Portable Analyzer, you will be greeted with a screen, with information in the middle and 7 slots on the right. The top slot is where you insert honey, and the slot below it is where you put your bee. As soon as the bee is put into the second slot, it will drop down one slot (to slot I). You can then move the bee down each slot to find out more information:

Each slot on the right will give you different information about the Bee.

The Beealyzer GUI is divided into 3 main sections:

![](Analyzer%20GUI.png)

* **Slot I - General Information**:
	* Species - type (Forest, Meadows, etc).
	* Lifespan - how long a Queen will live/work before producing the next generation.
	* Production - how quickly a Queen will produce combs or other goods.
	* Pollin (Pollination) - how quickly the bees will encourage their particular flower to grow, and also how quickly the bees will affect nearby trees for Arboriculture.
	* Flowers - The accepted variety of “flowers” the bees require to work. Most bees will use the red or yellow flowers found in Minecraft, though other types may use Cacti, or other types of plants…
	* Fertility - How many Drones the Queen will spawn when reproducing (a Princess is always produced).
	* Area - X, Y and Z dimensions (centred on the apiary or alveary) of the bees' territory. They search only within their territory for flowers, and may have an effect within it.
	* Effect - What effect (if any) the bees produce within their territory.
* **Slot II - Additional Information**:
	* Climate - What temperature the bee will be able to work in.
	* Temp.Tol (Temperature Tolerance) - The difference from its preferred Climate a bee will be able to work in.
	* Humidity - The bee’s preferred humidity.
	* Humid.Tol (Humidity Tolerance) - The difference from its preferred Humidity a bee will be able to work in.
	* Nocturnal - Whether or not the bee will work during nighttime (in addition to during the day).
	* Flyer - Whether or not the bee will be able to work during rain or snow.
	* Cave - Whether or not the bee’s housing (apiary or alveary) must be exposed to the sky for the bee to work.
	* Origin Type - Either Natural Origin (the bee was dropped from a hive or is descended from one that was) or Artificial Origin (the bee was produced by a swarmer or is descended from one that was).
	* Generations in Captivity - The number of generations since the original Princess that was dropped from a hive. Bees with Artificial Origin may die out from genetic exhaustion after some generations. Pristine bees will last indefinitely.
* **Slot III - Produce**: This page has two lists: Possible Produce lists all the items the bee will produce in the normal course of its life. Possible Specialty lists all the items the bee may produce if certain conditions are met (usually having to do with matching their preferred climate and humidity).
* **Slot IV - Mutations**: This slot outlines (graphically) the possible and discovered mutations of a bee.
* **Slot V - Classification & Description**: This slot contains other information about the bees that are not directly related to their function. A scientific classification is available for each bee, in addition to a short description. Some of the descriptions may contain useful information about the bee species, a hint on what to cross them with to get a mutation or an amusing quotation (your mileage may vary on what you find amusing). In general, this slot has little to no impact on the breeding mechanics.
