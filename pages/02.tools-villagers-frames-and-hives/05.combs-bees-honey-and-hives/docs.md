When wandering around in your world you will no doubt notice the various different types of Bee Hives scattered throughout different Biomes and even underground or underwater. These are Bee Hives. They contain bees, and if you get too close to some of these, you will get stung and take a little bit of Damage. Some bees do direct damage to you, and others poison you. 

Some bees do not stack because they have different attributes (we will cover this in more detail later).

When you hover over bees you will notice that each says “Unknown.” This is normal when first starting out, and each new bee you get in the future will also say this. You will learn more about these bees later.

So what else can bees do? Well, apart from give you Delicious Honey Bread, they can also give you:
* Resources
* Protection
* Status Effects
* Automation
* Animal Breeding

**Mundane Bees**

There are a total of 12 Mundane Hives (a Bee Species you can find in a hive depending on your mod pack), and each drops its own type of Bee and Honey. Each spawns in a different Area.
Honey comes from Combs and is used in the Portable Analyzer. It will help you identify Bees and help you choose what Bees to Breed or to throw away. It's the tool you will be using more than anything in the early stages of Bee Breeding. 

The Portable Analyzer tells you the Flowers, Temperature, LifeSpan, Offspring and much more about each bee that you scan. Think of it as a way to know everything about a Bee. More details about the Portable Analyzer later.

So where can all these hives be found?
