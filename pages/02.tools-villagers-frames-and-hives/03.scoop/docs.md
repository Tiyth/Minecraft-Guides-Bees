Hives can only be harvested with a Scoop. Breaking them with anything else will destroy the hive and drop nothing (there may be other mod items that will harvest Hives). When Hives are broken with a Scoop they will always drop a Princess and have a random chance at dropping a Drone and a Honeycomb (of the type the bee produces). These are all needed, so don't throw anything away. Your Scoop will not last forever. Bringing two or three on your first outing is a good idea. A Bee Smoker can be used on hives to suppress wild bees so the player can break it without harming the player. Without a smoker, harvesting a hive causes damage to the player.
