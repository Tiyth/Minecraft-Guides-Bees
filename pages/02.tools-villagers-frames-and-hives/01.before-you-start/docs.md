Jumping straight into Bees as soon as you start your world is possible but itâ€™s best if you are more prepared. This cuts down the time it takes for you to get into bees. I suggest you have the following in place before you start:  

* A stable Power Grid with the following Machines:
	* A Squeezer
		* Throw as many spare seeds into this and get as much Seed Oil as possible
	* 3 Carpenters
		* Water
		* Seed oil
		* Honey
	* A Centrifuge
		* Throw 3 or 4 Combs into this and Extract the Honey
* Logs/Wood
* Chests
* Wool
* Food
* A few Diamonds

It's recommended that you have a small base set up with food, a bed and shelter.
